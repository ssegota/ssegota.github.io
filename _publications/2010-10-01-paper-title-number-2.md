excerpt: 'Lowering joint torques of a robotic manipulator enables lowering the energy it uses as well as increase in the longevity of the robotic manipulator. This article proposes the use of evolutionary computation algorithms for optimizing the paths of the robotic manipulator with the goal of lowering the joint torques. The robotic manipulator used for optimization is modelled after a realistic six-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. Two cases are observed and these are a single robotic manipulator carrying a weight in a point-to-point trajectory and two robotic manipulators cooperating and moving the same weight along a calculated point-to-point trajectory. The article describes the process used for determining the kinematic properties using Denavit–Hartenberg method and the dynamic equations of the robotic manipulator using Lagrange–Euler and Newton–Euler algorithms.'
