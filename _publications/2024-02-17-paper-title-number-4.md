excerpt: 'Single-point incremental forming (SPIF) enables the forming of fix-clamped sheet metal by moving a relatively small geometrically simple tool along the trajectory, producing the desired shape of the final product. Excessive thinning of the sheet results in fracture, determining the limit of formability. This characteristic of the forming process can be improved by upgrading the basic SPIF process to two-step forming, whereby a more even distribution of the sheet thickness can be achieved by pre-bulging with a hemispherical punch. This study focused on analysing the SPIF process and a hybrid two-step forming consisting of sequential bulging and SPIF. The analysis focused on the output parameters of sheet metal thinning and maximum forming force components and was conducted with Abaqus simulation software. An innovative new approach for influence analysis of technological, material and geometrical input …'
